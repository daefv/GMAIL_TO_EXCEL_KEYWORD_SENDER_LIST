An app password is a unique password that allows you to access your Gmail account from third-party apps that do not support two-factor authentication. 
This is to ensure the security of your account while still allowing you to use those apps.
To get an app password for Gmail, you need to follow these steps:

1. Go to your Google Account settings by visiting https://myaccount.google.com/ and sign in if necessary.

2. Click on the "Security" tab on the left-hand side of the page.

3. Under the "Signing in to Google" section, click on "App passwords."

4. You may be asked to enter your Google account password again for security reasons. 
After you enter your password, you will be taken to the app passwords page.

5. Select the app for which you want to generate an app password.

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to generate the app password. 
You may need to provide the app name, device type, and other details to generate the password.

7. Once the app password is generated, copy it and use it to sign in to the app.
